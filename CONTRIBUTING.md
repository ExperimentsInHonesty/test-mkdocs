### Installation
This project requires Python and `pip`. 

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To locally test and develop, this command will `build` the files and serve the files with a webserver on `127.0.0.1:8000`
```
mkdocs serve
```

To build the documentation files only, run `mkdocs build`. Note that `mkdocs serve` automatically builds the files regardless.
