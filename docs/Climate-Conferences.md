#<center>Climate Conferences</center>

### Overview
There are hackathons, workshops, and other climate project events.  GreenEarthOS is creating a web based resource to make finding the organized climate conference that you are looking for easy.

### How we are going about it

#### We are surveying interested people to find out what criteria will make the events database most useful and easy to search.
Please take our 5 min [Event Criteria Priortization](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdqT9wLmk977l09I8Eyo6-fkBOsSB3cYKbm8cYzNMlX00eSVQ/viewform) survey.

#### We have collected data on all the climate events we could Google.  
See our work in progress [Event list spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M_YCauZ57cCHoxYfipm8XpQYX0pMA7mFvYKFGDqbi_0/preview) or [Tell us about an event](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdamAqGK__sJzx0E8dIApmP95hNhb8wGTsEs--TmtAPaFVCgA/viewform) that we don't know about yet!!

The types of data we have collected are:
- Local events (Geographically co-located in the same region)
- Type of events / Entrance criteria of the events
- Frequency of the events
- Coaching/Mentoring, Funder details
