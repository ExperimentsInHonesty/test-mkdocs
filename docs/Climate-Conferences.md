#<center>Climate Conferences</center>

### Overview
We are defining Climate Conferences as hackathons, workshops, and other climate events that bring people together to discuss and/or work on climate projects.  GreenEarthOS is creating a web based resource to make finding the organized climate conference that you are looking for easy.

Read our [overview](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a2QUorc_V0Cj6mARQNR60urzYAj1vOU9p_ceom2ec54/preview)

### How we are going about it

#### We are surveying interested people to find out what criteria will make the conference events database most useful and easy to search.
Please take our 5 min [Conference Event Criteria Priortization](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdqT9wLmk977l09I8Eyo6-fkBOsSB3cYKbm8cYzNMlX00eSVQ/viewform) survey.

#### We have collected data on all the climate conferences we could Google.  
See our work in progress [Conference Event list spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M_YCauZ57cCHoxYfipm8XpQYX0pMA7mFvYKFGDqbi_0/preview) or [Tell us about an conference](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdamAqGK__sJzx0E8dIApmP95hNhb8wGTsEs--TmtAPaFVCgA/viewform) that we don't know about yet!!

The types of data we have collected are:
- Local conferences (Geographically co-located in the same region)
- Type of conference / Entrance criteria of the conference
- Frequency of the conference
- Coaching/Mentoring, Funder details
