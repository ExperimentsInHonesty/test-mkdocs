The GreenEarthOS project seeks to create and publish a map of the
current climate project support landscape including gaps. Once the
landscape has been created the project will work to create visible
guidance for open source projects and project ideators on how to
navigate the landscape and connect with players at every appropriate
stage (recruiting, mentoring, partnerships, packaging and funding);
thereby reducing barriers to currently under represented
communities.
