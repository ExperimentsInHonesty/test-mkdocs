# Project title and description

The [Open Climate Collabathon](https://www.collabathon.openclimate.earth) is a form of collabathonâ€“an event based on a principle of radical collaboration and crowd-development. It is an open event mobilizing a global network of Universities, civic tech groups, startups and youth to crowd-develop an integrated climate accounting platform by leveraging state-of-the-art digital technologies. Climate accounting solutions are designed to help the world track and achieve the goals of the Paris climate agreement.

## Installation instructions

1. Step-by-step instructions help new contributors get a development environment up and running quickly.
2. You'll want to find the balance between being specific enough for novices to follow, without being so specific that you reinvent the wheel by providing overly-basic instructions that can be found elsewhere.
3. Feel free to adapt this section and its sub-sections to your own processes.
4. Alternatively, you can move everything from *Installation instructions* through *Testing* to a separate **Contributing.md** file to keep your **ReadMe.md** more succinct.
